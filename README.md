Car Racing Game
Description
This project is a 3D Car Racing Game developed using WebGL and JavaScript. It showcases a hierarchical scene graph to manage 3D object transformations and relationships. Phong lighting and textures are applied to create realistic visuals. The user can control a car’s movement with keyboard inputs, and the camera dynamically follows the car.

Features
3D Scene Graph: Hierarchical structure for managing object relationships and transformations.
Lighting and Texturing: Applied Phong lighting and multiple textures for realistic rendering.
Procedural Generation: Dynamically created objects like UV spheres.
Model Loading: Imported external OBJ models with materials.
Dynamic Camera: Camera follows the car’s movement dynamically.
Future Enhancements
Adding dynamic lights for richer lighting effects.
Implementing auto-generated terrain using heightmaps.
Technologies Used
WebGL
JavaScript
