# Cpts483-FinalProject - Car Racing Game

## Description  
Developed a **3D car racing game** using WebGL and JavaScript. The project implements a hierarchical **scene graph** to manage 3D object transformations and relationships. Phong lighting and textured objects create realistic visuals. The user can control car movement with keyboard inputs, and the camera dynamically follows the car.  

## Features  
- **3D Scene Graph**: Manage transformations and object relationships.  
- **Lighting and Texturing**: Phong lighting and textured 3D objects for realism.  
- **Procedural Objects**: Dynamically generated UV spheres.  
- **Model Loading**: Imported external **OBJ models** with materials.  
- **Camera Controls**: Follow the car dynamically with keyboard input.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Adding **dynamic lights**.  
- Implementing **auto-generated terrain** using heightmaps.  

## Technologies Used  
- **WebGL**  
- **JavaScript**
